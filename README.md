Python
======

OperPy is a new python library containing useful numerical and data-structure operations.

StudentGradeBook.py

This is a student grade book application. It allows you to assign weightage of tests, homework, classwork, 
and the final exam. You can instantiate students and assign them scores in each one of these categories. The program
will calculate the final grade of the student and report various statistics as well.

gradebooktest.py

This program tests the GradeBook class. It also shows how to create a hash table with all the students info's.

Upcoming Projects (which I am currently working on):

Bank Account Manager in which there is an abtract class called "Account" and many different accounts you can manage
under that. There will also be a GUI to view and compare info from your different accounts.
